This is the repository for TWINFER - a framework for gene regulatory network inference using single-cell transcriptomic data and twin cells. 

The folder simulation_scripts/gillespie_simulation contains the code for simulating the data from a given GRN and parameters. It has also has the code used to identify parameters from literature and generate parameters for creating simulations.
The folder analysis_code (in progress) has the code to perform the inference and other analysis.

The folder data/parameters_from_literature has all the source files from original literature used to estimate biologically realistic parameter ranges.
The folder data/simulation_input has a few example interaction matrices and median parameters as an example.
